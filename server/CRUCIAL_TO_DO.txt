In order to push forward and allow us to get to some actual prototyping of features,
some CRUCIAL elements of the project have been neglected. The following is a (non-exhaustive) 
list of things that would need to be completed before even thinking releasing anything publically
would be OK.

- Server-side user input validation.
- Email verification flow (currently new signups are just automatically validated).
- Proper handling of errors.
- Logout
- Add secure flag for cookies in production.
- Survey and research auth
  - Express res.cookie, signed cookies?, use 'secure' flag in production
  - Common attacks - am I protected?
